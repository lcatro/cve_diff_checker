 ## 2.7.0 / 2019-01-28
 
 We're rolling back the Dockerfile changes introduced in 2.6.0. If you made changes to your docker deployment in 2.6.0, you will need to roll them back. This release also adds experimental support for disk size based retention. To accomodate that we are deprecating the flag `storage.tsdb.retention` in favour of `storage.tsdb.retention.time`. We print a warning if the flag is in use, but it will function without breaking until Prometheus 3.0.
