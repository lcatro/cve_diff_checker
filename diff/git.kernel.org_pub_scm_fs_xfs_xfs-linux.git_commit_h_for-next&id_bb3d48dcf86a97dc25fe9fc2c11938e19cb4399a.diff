Subject: xfs: don't call xfs_da_shrink_inode with NULL bp

xfs_attr3_leaf_create may have errored out before instantiating a buffer,
for example if the blkno is out of range.  In that case there is no work
to do to remove it, and in fact xfs_da_shrink_inode will lead to an oops
if we try.

This also seems to fix a flaw where the original error from
xfs_attr3_leaf_create gets overwritten in the cleanup case, and it
removes a pointless assignment to bp which isn't used after this.
